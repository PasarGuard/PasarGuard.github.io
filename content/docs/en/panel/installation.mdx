### Post Installation

Once the installation is complete:

-   You will see the logs that you can stop watching them by closing the terminal or pressing `Ctrl+C`
-   The PasarGuard files will be located at `/opt/pasarguard`
-   The configuration file can be found at `/opt/pasarguard/.env` (refer to [configurations](#configuration) section to see variables)
-   The data files will be placed at `/var/lib/pasarguard`
-   For security reasons, the PasarGuard dashboard is not accessible via IP address. Therefore, you must [obtain SSL certificate](https://PasarGuard.github.io/PasarGuard/en/examples/issue-ssl-certificate) and access your PasarGuard dashboard by opening a web browser and navigating to `https://YOUR_DOMAIN:8000/dashboard/` (replace YOUR_DOMAIN with your actual domain)
-   You can also use SSH port forwarding to access the PasarGuard dashboard locally without a domain. Replace `user@serverip` with your actual SSH username and server IP and Run the command below:

```bash
ssh -L 8000:localhost:8000 user@serverip
```

Finally, you can enter the following link in your browser to access your PasarGuard dashboard:

http://localhost:8000/dashboard/

You will lose access to the dashboard as soon as you close the SSH terminal. Therefore, this method is recommended only for testing purposes.

### Create Admin User

Next, you need to create a sudo admin for logging into the PasarGuard dashboard by the following command

```bash
pasarguard tui
```

That's it! You can login to your dashboard using these credentials

To see the help message of the PasarGuard script, run the following command

```bash
pasarguard --help
```
