The following tutorials are for obtaining SSL certificates for use with pasarguard using the command line (CLI).

<Callout type="warn">
Certificate files must be accessible at `/var/lib/pasarguard/certs` for pasarguard to access them.

In all examples below, files will be installed at this location.
</Callout>

<Callout type="warn">
You must register DNS records for your domain before obtaining an SSL certificate.

## Obtaining Certificate with acme.sh

### Installing Prerequisites

Install socat using the following command for standalone mode:

```bash
apt install curl socat -y
```

<Callout type="info">
If you have already installed socat, you don't need to perform this step.
</Callout>

### Installing acme.sh

Install [acme.sh](https://github.com/acmesh-official/acme.sh) with the following command.

Replace `YOUR_EMAIL` with your email address.

<Callout type="info">
If you have already installed acme.sh, you don't need to perform this step.
</Callout>

```bash
curl https://get.acme.sh | sh -s email=YOUR_EMAIL
```

### Obtaining Certificate

To obtain a certificate, execute the following commands in order.

Replace `YOUR_DOMAIN` with your desired domain or subdomain.

```bash
export DOMAIN=YOUR_DOMAIN

mkdir -p /var/lib/pasarguard/certs

~/.acme.sh/acme.sh \
  --issue --force --standalone -d "$DOMAIN" \
  --fullchain-file "/var/lib/pasarguard/certs/$DOMAIN.cer" \
  --key-file "/var/lib/pasarguard/certs/$DOMAIN.cer.key"
```

## Obtaining Certificate for Cloudflare Domain

If your domain is registered on Cloudflare and the above methods don't work, use manual mode.

Replace `example.com` with your domain.

### Installing acme.sh

After installing acme, execute the following steps:

```bash
curl https://get.acme.sh | sh -s email=YOUR_EMAIL
```

### Step 1: Request Certificate

```bash
~/.acme.sh/acme.sh --issue -d example.com --dns \
 --yes-I-know-dns-manual-mode-enough-go-ahead-please
```

After execution, you will receive two values as shown in the image below:

<ImageZoom
  src="/images/learn/ssl-cloudflare-dns-values.png"
  alt="Cloudflare DNS verification values"
  width={800}
  height={400}
/>

### Step 2: Configure DNS Record

Go to Cloudflare and create a TXT record, entering the values as shown in the image below:

<ImageZoom
  src="/images/learn/ssl-cloudflare-txt-record.png"
  alt="Creating TXT record in Cloudflare"
  width={800}
  height={400}
/>

### Step 3: Obtain Certificate

Obtain the certificate with the following command:

```bash
~/.acme.sh/acme.sh --renew -d example.com \
  --yes-I-know-dns-manual-mode-enough-go-ahead-please
```

### File Paths

Finally, your domain certificate file will be at:

```
/root/.acme.sh/example.com_ecc/fullchain.cer
```

And the private key file will be saved at:

```
/root/.acme.sh/example.com_ecc/example.com.key
```
