# CloudFlare Warp Activation

Using this tutorial, you can bypass certain restrictions imposed by large companies like Google and Spotify on your IP and use their services without issues.

<Callout type="warn">
Note that Warp configs have a maximum connection limit of 5 simultaneous devices. To solve this issue, you can use multiple configs.
</Callout>

## Step 1: Creating Wireguard Config

### Method 1: Using Windows

1. First, download the required `Asset` from the [releases](https://github.com/ViRb3/wgcf/releases) section. This file varies depending on your processor.
2. Rename the `Asset` file to `wgcf`.
3. Now enter `cmd.exe` in the File Explorer address bar.

/>

4. In the opened terminal, enter `wgcf.exe`.
5. Execute `wgcf.exe register` once, then `wgcf.exe generate`.
6. A new file named `wgcf-profile.conf` will be created - this is the `Wireguard` config we need.
7. Your config is ready and you can use it.

### Method 2: Using Linux

First, download the required `Asset` from the [releases](https://github.com/ViRb3/wgcf/releases) section. This file varies depending on your processor.

You can do this using the `wget` command.

#### For AMD64 architecture processors:

```bash
wget https://github.com/ViRb3/wgcf/releases/download/v2.2.22/wgcf_2.2.22_linux_amd64
```

#### For ARM64 architecture processors:

```bash
wget https://github.com/ViRb3/wgcf/releases/download/v2.2.22/wgcf_2.2.22_linux_arm64
```

Move the file to `/usr/bin/` and rename it to `wgcf`.

#### For AMD64 architecture processors:

```bash
mv wgcf_2.2.22_linux_amd64 /usr/bin/wgcf
chmod +x /usr/bin/wgcf
```

#### For ARM64 architecture processors:

```bash
mv wgcf_2.2.22_linux_arm64 /usr/bin/wgcf
chmod +x /usr/bin/wgcf
```

Then create the config using these 2 commands:

```bash
wgcf register
wgcf generate
```

A file named `wgcf-profile.conf` will be created - this is the config we need.

## Step 2: Using Warp+ (Optional)

To obtain a license and use Warp+, you can get a `license_key` through [this](https://t.me/generatewarpplusbot) Telegram bot.

After obtaining the `license_key`, you need to replace it in the `wgcf-account.toml` file.

<Callout type="info">
You can make this change in Linux with `nano` and in Windows with `Notepad` or any other software.
</Callout>

<Callout type="info" title="Windows">
To use commands on Windows, you need to use `wgcf.exe` instead of `wgcf`.
</Callout>

Then update the config information:

```bash
wgcf update
```

Then create a new config file:

```bash
wgcf generate
```

## Step 3: Activating Warp on PasarGuard

### Method 1: Using Xray Core

<Callout type="warn">
- This method is only recommended for Xray version 1.8.3 or higher. In older versions, you may encounter Memory Leak issues.
- If your `Xray` version is lower than this, you can upgrade your `Xray` version using the Xray-core version change tutorial.
</Callout>

Go to Core Setting in the PasarGuard panel.

First, add an outbound like the example and place the `wgcf-profile.conf` file information in it.

```json
{
  "tag": "warp",
  "protocol": "wireguard",
  "settings": {
    "secretKey": "Your_Secret_Key",
    "DNS": "1.1.1.1",
    "address": ["172.16.0.2/32", "2606:4700:110:8756:9135:af04:3778:40d9/128"],
    "peers": [
      {
        "publicKey": "bmXOC+F1FxEMF9dyiK2H5/1SUtzH0JuVo51h2wPfgyo=",
        "endpoint": "engage.cloudflareclient.com:2408"
      }
    ],
    "kernelMode": false
  }
}
```

<Callout type="info">
If you want all traffic to pass through Warp by default, place this Outbound first and you don't need to perform the next step.
</Callout>

### Method 2: Using Wireguard Core

First, install the Wireguard prerequisites on the server:

```bash
sudo apt install wireguard-dkms wireguard-tools resolvconf
```

If you're using Ubuntu 24, use the following command to install Wireguard:

```bash
sudo apt install wireguard
```

Then add `Table = off` to the Wireguard file as shown in the example:

```ini
[Interface]
PrivateKey = Your_Private_Key
Address = 172.16.0.2/32
Address = 2606:4700:110:8a1a:85ef:da37:b891:8d01/128
DNS = 1.1.1.1
MTU = 1280
Table = off
[Peer]
PublicKey = bmXOC+F1FxEMF9dyiK2H5/1SUtzH0JuVo51h2wPfgyo=
AllowedIPs = 0.0.0.0/0
AllowedIPs = ::/0
Endpoint = engage.cloudflareclient.com:2408
```

<Callout type="warn">
If you don't add `Table = off`, your server access will be cut off and you won't be able to connect to the server. You'll need to access the server through your datacenter's website and disconnect from `Warp` to be able to establish a normal connection again.
</Callout>

Then rename the file from `wgcf-profile.conf` to `warp.conf`.

Place the file in the `/etc/wireguard` folder on the server:

```bash
sudo mv wgcf-profile.conf /etc/wireguard/warp.conf
```

Enable Wireguard with the following command:

```bash
sudo systemctl enable --now wg-quick@warp
```

You can also disable `Warp` with this command:

```bash
sudo systemctl disable --now wg-quick@warp
```

Go to Core Setting in the PasarGuard panel.

First, add an outbound like the example:

```json
{
  "tag": "warp",
  "protocol": "freedom",
  "streamSettings": {
    "sockopt": {
      "tcpFastOpen": true,
      "interface": "warp"
    }
  }
}
```

<Callout type="info">
If you want all traffic to pass through Warp by default, place this Outbound first and you don't need to perform the next step.
</Callout>

## Step 4: Routing Configuration

First, add a `rule` in the `routing` section like the example:

```json
{
  "outboundTag": "warp",
  "domain": [],
  "type": "field"
}
```

Now add your desired websites like the example:

```json
{
    "outboundTag": "warp",
    "domain": [
        "geosite:google",
        "openai.com",
        "ai.com",
        "ipinfo.io",
        "iplocation.net",
        "spotify.com"
    ],
    "type": "field"
}
```

Save the changes - you can now use `Warp`.

### PasarGuard Node

- If you're using `Warp` with the xray core, you don't need to make changes to the node - it will be applied automatically.
- If you're using the `Wireguard` core, you need to perform step three, method two on the node as well.
